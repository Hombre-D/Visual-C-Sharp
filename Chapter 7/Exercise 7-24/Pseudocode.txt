Write method Perfect that determines whether parameter value is perfect.
Use this method to determines and displays all perfect numbers, along with their factors.
Check numbers 2-1000 to determine if they are perfect, and display their factors.


static void Perfect(int value):
	int total = 0;
	string factors;
	if (value % 2 != 0):
		//do nothing

	else:
		for (int i = 0; i < value; ++i):
			if (value % i == 0):
				total += i;
				factors = factors + i + " ";
	if (total == value):
		display value "is perfect!"
		display "Factors: " + factors
