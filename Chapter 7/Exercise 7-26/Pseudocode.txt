//Write a method that takes an integer value and returns the number with the integers reversed.


Method ReverseDigits (int a):
	int quotient = a / 10
	int remainder = a % 10
	int reverse = remainder
	while (quotient != 0):
		int i = 1
		quotient = a / 10
		remainder = a % 10
		reverse = reverse + (remainder * Math.Pow(10, i))
		++i
	return reverse
